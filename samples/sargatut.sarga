"
Sarga helps to create and run books with audio and visual elements.
This is similar to visual novels but with a more general focus - so that
you can create textbooks, stories, tutorials, articles etc.
"

"
Note that Sarga doesn't replace graphical or audio creation tools. It helps you become
the play director and producer, bringing textual, audio and visual elements together on
a screen. The audio and visual contents can be created using applications and/or generated
in code. Only their appearance (and disappearance) on the stage is controlled in Sarga.
