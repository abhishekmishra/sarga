Duck: "Quack"
Narrator: "Note that Sarga doesn't replace graphical or audio creation tools. It helps you become
the play director and producer, bringing textual, audio and visual elements together on
a screen. The audio and visual contents can be created using applications and/or generated
in code. Only their appearance (and disappearance) on the stage is controlled in Sarga.
